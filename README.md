T-Accounts
----------

A web app to do financial accounting problems with T-Accounts. 

I originally wanted this when taking Financial and Managerial Acccounting courses a few years ago, and was getting tired of making the same spreadsheet every time for all my homework problems. I was surprised to not find any existing websites that would let you do some quick T-Accounts and transactions in an intuitive, accouting-friendly way. **I am not an accountant**, but my goal is to stay true to accounting style.

Running
-------
